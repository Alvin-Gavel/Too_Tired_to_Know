# Too Tired to Know
Study of the effects of sleep deprivation on metacognition

## Mathematical details
Following BÃ¼rkner and Vourre (2019) we implement a cumulative model to analyse the results.

## Files
- `Binomial_analysis.R`: R code that makes a straightforward analysis of the data.
- `Cumulative_model_analysis.R`: R code that makes an arguably more sophisticated, but also harder to interpret, analysis of the data.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Directories
- `Data`: This directory must exist, and contains the data to be analysed.
- `Documentation`: This directory contains a more detailed description of the mathematical details of the analysis.
